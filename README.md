# hotelling2d

This is code for the 2d hotelling app at https://g-econ.shinyapps.io/2dhotelling.

To test this app locally, you will need to set up an SQL database and create a `dbcredentials.R` file to point to that database. An example of this file is provided in `dbcredentials.R.example`. The structure of the database is provided in the comments in `app.R`.
